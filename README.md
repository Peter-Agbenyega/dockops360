It consists of:
- **App Container:** Lightweight Alpine + Busybox web server
- **Database Container:** MariaDB database service
- **Nginx Container:** Reverse proxy and load balancer

All containers are orchestrated using `docker-compose.yml` for simple local development and testing.

## Architecture Overview

- **/db**: MariaDB database container
- **/nginx**: Nginx reverse proxy container
- **docker-compose.yml**: Service orchestration
